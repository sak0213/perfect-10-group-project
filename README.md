Olympic Data Review

The goal of our project is to provide a comprehensive review of Olympic data by reviewing the profile
and result for each athlete, sport, and country and cross-reference this data with census and GDP data.
We began our review by pulling csv data from Kaggle.com and the World Bank. Once the data was
compiled, we proceeded to clean the data by reviewing null values, errors, and providing a merging the
data into one data frame using the country name as the index.

Once the data was in an acceptable format, we began creating various groups for reviewing the data by
athlete, sport, and country. We created additional columns to contain measures for breaking out the
athlete and country medal count as well as create a “Win Rate” percentage that would illustrate the
success of an athlete or country by comparing their total medals to the number of attempts they made
for a medal. These measures allowed us to proceed with our visuals.
We chose to utilize bar, pie, and scatterplot visuals to illustrate the various data frames created. Our bar
charts allowed quick views of top athletes and countries by medal count and win rate. To show the
male-female gender diversity over time and overall % chance of winning a medal over time, we focused
on using pie charts to show those data points and clearly translate this information. Our scatterplots
allowed us to see correlations between population and GDP to know if these have a direct relationship
with a county’s success for winning medals.

In conclusion, we found several key points that stood out. First, we did note that since 1960 those
countries with the highest populations and highest GDP were more successful than those countries with
smaller populations and GDP. Over time, the USA has won the most medals in the Olympics. Russia
(formerly USSR) showed that they are the most successful country for winning medals for events they
participate (Win Rate). Over time, more male athletes have participated than female athletes. For those
athletes competing for a medal, there is less than a 15% chance on average that they will win a medal.

We hope you enjoyed this review of Olympic athletes, sports, and countries. The Olympics remains a
staple of international cooperation though multiple wars and changes in governments. We believe that
future Olympic results will continue to prove a valuable data point for reviewing a countries
international status include GDP and population.
